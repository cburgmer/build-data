Just a few pointers if you want to make changes to build-facts:

## Run the tests

    $ ./go

## Run sync for Jenkins locally

    $ ./lein run -m build-facts.main jenkins http://$USER:$PW@localhost:8080

## Make a new release

    $ ./go make_release 1.2.3

## Re-generating the recorded traffic from actual GoCD server

Re-generating the traffic, captured via wiremock, is necessary if a new API is
accessed in the sync that hasn't been captured yet, or any URL access has been
slightly changed:

    $ ./test/smoke/record_gocd.sh

The recorded file needs to be checked in to provide regression testing for the
relevant sync job.
